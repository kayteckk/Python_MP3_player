# Python MP3 Player
 A simple Python MP3 player with GUI using PyQt5

Completely redesigned the app and changed tkinter and pygame into PyQt5.


Changes to be made:
1. For now if we manipulate the volume slider for some reason until we stop moving it and unpress it the timeline slider moves in random direction (comes back to normal after lifting the volume slider. Just a cosmetical issue)
2. Implement a smooth slider
3. Remove selected song from the playlist
4. Add a sqlite DB to preserve songs and paths.
