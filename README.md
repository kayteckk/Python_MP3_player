# Python WAV Player
 A simple python WAV player with GUI in tkinter and pygame

Changes to be made:
1. Slider should update each second as the label does.
2. previous song is not implemented.
3. DB to be made using sqlite to preserve imported tracks.
4. ~~Auto-selection of the first imported track to be done.~~
5. ~~After the import slider label says -1:59 instead of 00:00. Need to fix.~~

In the future the player should work with other filetypes than WAV (current issues with libraries and improper conversion leading to time discrepancies).
